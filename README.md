# battery-health-management-system
This Python script predicts battery health metrics, such as State of Charge and State of Health, using linear regression and visualizes the actual versus predicted values.


Battery Management System (BMS) Prediction and Analysis

Overview

This project demonstrates a basic Battery Management System (BMS) prediction and analysis using Python. The program utilizes preset battery data to train simple models for predicting the State of Charge (SOC), State of Health (SOH), cell voltage, and overcurrent status of battery cells. It employs linear regression for SOC and SOH predictions, calculates the mean for cell voltage prediction, and uses a majority vote for overcurrent protection prediction.
 Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

-pip install numpy pandas matplotlib


Instructions
Step 1: Prepare the Environment

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python packages:


pip install numpy pandas matplotlib


 Step 2: Running the Program

1. Save the provided code in a file named `bms_prediction.py`.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `bms_prediction.py` is saved.

3. Run the script using Python:

python bms_prediction.py

Step 3: Understanding the Output

The script will generate two plots:
 Actual vs Predicted State of Charge (SOC)
 Actual vs Predicted State of Health (SOH)
  
  These plots will visualize the actual SOC and SOH values against the predicted values based on the linear regression model.
Code Explanation

- Import Libraries: The script imports necessary libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
- Preset Battery Data: A dictionary containing preset battery data is defined, which includes `Cell Voltage`, `Temperature`, `Current`, `State of Charge`, `State of Health`, and `Overcurrent`.
- Data Preparation: The preset data is converted into a Pandas DataFrame. Features (input) and targets (outputs) are split for SOC, SOH, cell voltage, and overcurrent predictions.
- Model Training:
  - SOC and SOH models are trained using linear regression on `Cell Voltage`.
  - Cell voltage model uses the mean of preset data.
  - Overcurrent model uses the majority vote of preset data.
- Predictions:
  - SOC predictions are made for test data using the SOC model.
  - SOH predictions are made for test data using the SOH model.
  - Cell voltage predictions are made using the mean value.
  - Overcurrent predictions are made using the majority vote.
- Visualization: Matplotlib is used to create scatter plots and regression lines to compare actual and predicted SOC and SOH values.

Conclusion

This script provides a simple demonstration of using basic machine learning techniques to predict battery health metrics. For a real-world application, more sophisticated models and larger datasets would be necessary. This project serves as an educational example of how to perform basic data analysis and visualization using Python.
